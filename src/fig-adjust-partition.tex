  \caption{Mean relative runtime with our \textit{Dynamic Frontier (DF)} and \textit{Dynamic Frontier with Pruning (DF-P)} approaches across three different levels of work-partitioning for GPU computation. Here, \textit{Partition $G$} denotes partitioning the vertices of the current graph $G$ by their out-degree, while \textit{Partition $G'$} signifies partitioning the vertices by their in-degree. Note that $G'$ stands for the transpose of the current graph $G$.}
