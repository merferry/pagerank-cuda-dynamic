In conclusionl, in this report, we introduced one of the most efficient GPU implementations of Static PageRank, which involves recomputing PageRank scores from scratch. This implementation employs a synchronous pull-based approach for PageRank computation, devoid of atomics. It partitions and processes low and high in-degree vertices using two separate kernels. Furthermore, we presented our GPU implementation of Dynamic Frontier with Pruning (DF-P) PageRank, which incrementally expands (and contracts) the set of vertices likely to undergo rank changes. It is based on Static PageRank, and introduces additional partitioning between low and high out-degree vertices for the incremental expansion of the affected vertices set, implemented through two additional kernels. On a server equipped with an NVIDIA A100 GPU, we showed that our Static PageRank implementation outperforms Hornet and Gunrock's PageRank implementations by $31\times$ and $5.9\times$, respectively. Additionally, it achieves a speedup of $24\times$ compared to our multicore Static PageRank. Furthermore, DF-P PageRank demonstrates superior performance compared to Static PageRank, achieving a speedup of $2.1\times$ on real-world dynamic graphs and $3.1\times$ on large static graphs with random batch updates.
